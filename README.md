## XOX-TicTacToe Game

I made this game when I didn't know much about OOP. So  this game consists of 13 thousand lines of code. I uploaded this game for other people to consider "how i can reduce the number of codes using OOP". 

Also some buttons may have bugs. Like i said consider this game as inexperienced work and try to fix and improve. 


## About Game

The game is very similiar to classic Tic-Tac-Toe (XOX). Game is played with two people. Each player can choose any mark ('S' or 'O' ). When a **"SOS"** pattern forms on the board, the player scores a point and continues playing. When there are no empty squares on the board, game is over and the player with more points wins the game.
